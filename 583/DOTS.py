where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

Example 1:
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Note:
The length of given words won't exceed 500.
Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.
